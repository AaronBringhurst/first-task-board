## Overview
Task Board is a simple yet powerful Kanban board designed to help individuals and teams track their tasks efficiently. Inspired by the principles of Kanban, Task Board allows users to create, manage, and move tasks through different stages of completion, from "To Do" to "In Progress" and "Done."
